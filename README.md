<h2>Project Overview: 2Market Customer Analysis</h2>

<p>As part of the Data Analytics for Business course, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis for 2Market, a global supermarket, focusing on understanding customer demographics, spending behaviours, and marketing channel effectiveness to help re-engage inactive customer segments.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In the challenging aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, 2Market faced a significant sales downturn during Q3 2013. This project aimed to understand the factors behind customer inactivity and recommend strategies for re-engagement and improved customer retention.</p>

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>The analysis aimed to uncover key customer insights, identify reasons for non-spending, and evaluate the effectiveness of current marketing channels, ultimately guiding strategic decision-making to improve sales and engagement.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Using advanced Excel functions, PostgreSQL for database querying, and Tableau for visualisation, I performed a comprehensive data exploration to present insights via an interactive dashboard, focusing on consumer insights and data-driven recommendations.</p>
